An engine I've been developing for an Audio Visualizer.

Written in C++ and GLSL using Visual Studio

Opens and reads the audio file, extracts its features -including amplitudes of the waveform and frequency magnitudes using FFTW- and uses them for visualization. These features will be used to modify the animated scene.
